# A couple notes
- Some of the code in this directory was created to work with older versions of Philter, so it might require adjustment to work with a newer version of Philter
- If a file has whitespace in the name (eg. "for philter beta (obsolete)") it's old, extra, or not important
- ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` is, funnily enough, my documentation :grin:
- ```CHANGE_LOG.md``` has everything I modified/added from the original Philter fork :fork_and_knife:
- ```details_on_scripts.md``` contains details about my scripts!
- ```common_symbols.txt``` is a list of the gene symbols I used to compile my test set of clinical notes
- ```gene_symbols_whitelist/``` contains files I used to make the gene symbols whitelist
- ```mimic_test_set/``` contains files I used when making the test set of clinical notes
- ```pathology_terms/``` contains files I used when working on rescuing pathology terms
- ```prune_whitelist/``` contains mostly files from a previous intern plus one or two of my things for removing values from a whitelist
- ```scripts/``` contains scripts I wrote and their output
