# A couple notes
- ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` is, funnily enough, my documentation :grin:
- ```CHANGE-LOG.md``` contains everything I modified/added
- [Link](https://github.com/pauliwog/philter-data) to the data I used
- Some of the code in this directory was created to work with Philter-Beta, so it might require adjustment to work with this newer version of Philter.
