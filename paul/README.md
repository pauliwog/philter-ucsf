# A couple notes
- Some of the code in this directory was created to work with Philter-Beta, so it might require adjustment to work with a newer version of Philter
- Here's a [link](https://github.com/pauliwog/philter-data) to all the data I used—MIMIC, i2b2, pathology examples, etc—email me at burke.invent@gmail.com to get access
- If a file has whitespace in the name (eg. ```for philter beta (obsolete)```) it's extra and not important
- ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` is, funnily enough, my documentation :grin:
- ```CHANGE-LOG.md``` contains everything I modified/added from the original Philter fork :fork_and_knife:
- ```details_on_scripts.md``` contains details about my scripts!
- ```common_symbols.txt``` contains the symbols I used to make my test set of clinical notes
- ```'for philter beta (obsolete)'/``` contains old scripts/statistics which might come in handy
- ```gene_symbols/``` contains files I used to make the gene symbols whitelist
- ```mimic_data/``` contains files I created when making the test set of clinical notes
- ```pathology/``` contains files I used when working on rescuing pathology terms
- ```prune_whitelist/``` contains mostly files from a previous intern plus one or two of my things for removing common english words/names from a whitelist
- ```scripts/``` contains scripts I wrote and their output—these are for lots of things (more details in details_on_scripts.md)
