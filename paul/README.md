# A couple notes
- Some of the code in this directory was created to work with Philter-Beta, so it might require adjustment to work with a newer version of Philter
- Here's [a link](https://github.com/pauliwog/philter-data) to all the data I used (MIMIC, i2b2, pathology examples, etc), if you wish to access it I would need proof of [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/) and [i2b2](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/#) approval.
- If a file has whitespace in the name (eg. "for philter beta (obsolete)") it's old, extra, or not important
- ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` is, funnily enough, my documentation :grin:
- ```CHANGE_LOG.md``` has everything I modified/added from the original Philter fork :fork_and_knife:
- ```details_on_scripts.md``` contains details about my scripts!
- ```common_symbols.txt``` is a list of the symbols I used to compile my test set of clinical notes
- ```'for philter beta (obsolete)'/``` contains old files which might come in handy sometime
- ```gene_symbols/``` contains files I used to make the gene symbols whitelist
- ```mimic_data/``` contains files I created when making the test set of clinical notes
- ```pathology/``` contains files I used when working on rescuing pathology terms
- ```prune_whitelist/``` contains mostly files from a previous intern plus one or two of my things for removing common english words/names from a whitelist
- ```scripts/``` contains scripts I wrote and their outputâ€”these are for lots of things (more details in details_on_scripts.md)
